        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a computer science major waiting to transfer to a 4 year college in the next few months. 
            I have always enjoyed the creative process behind codinng and the journey of making a project come to life. 
            Beside coding, I also enjoy drawing and other artistic hobbies that I can combine with my programming skills.</p>
